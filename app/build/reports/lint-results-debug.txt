/Users/reeceharding/ExcessEatsNew/app/lint-baseline.xml: Information: 2 errors/warnings were listed in the baseline file (lint-baseline.xml) but not found in the project; perhaps they have been fixed? Another possible explanation is that lint recently stopped analyzing (and including results from) dependent projects by default. You can turn this back on with android.lintOptions.checkDependencies=true. Unmatched issue types: UseAppTint (2) [LintBaseline]
/Users/reeceharding/ExcessEatsNew/app/build.gradle:68: Warning: A newer version of com.android.tools:desugar_jdk_libs than 2.0.4 is available: 2.1.3 [GradleDependency]

   Explanation for issues of type "GradleDependency":
   This detector looks for usages of libraries where the version you are using
   is not the current stable release. Using older versions is fine, and there
   are cases where you deliberately want to stick with an older version.
   However, you may simply not be aware that a more recent version is
   available, and that is what this lint check helps find.
